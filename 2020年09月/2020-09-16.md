Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments or talents and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".
冒名顶替症候群或者骗子症候群。这个名称是在1978年由临床心理学家Pauline R. Clance与Suzanne A. Imes所提出，用以指称出现在成功人士身上的一种现象。患有冒名顶替症候群的人无法将自己的成功归因于自己的能力，并总是担心有朝一日会被他人识破自己其实是骗子这件事。他们坚信自己的成功并非源于自己的努力或能力，而是凭借著运气、良好的时机，或别人误以为他们能力很强、很聪明，才导致他们的成功 。即使现实环境中的证据指明，他们确实具备优秀才能，他们还是认为自己只是骗子，不值得获得成功。有研究显示，冒名顶替症候群在高成就女性当中较为常见 ；同时也有研究指出男性与女性的盛行率没有差异
